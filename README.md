Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective : Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.
## Tools : Wireshark (free).
## Deliverables : A packet capture (.pcap) file and a short report of protocols identified.

This repository contains my submission for Cyber Security Internship – Task 5, where I captured live network traffic using Wireshark, analyzed it, and identified key protocols.
The goal of this task was to gain hands-on experience with packet capture, filtering, and protocol analysis.

## Tools Used : Wireshark

## Key Concepts : Packet capture, protocol analysis, TCP/IP, network troubleshooting, filtering.

**Steps Performed**

1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Selected the active Wi-Fi interface and started live capture.
3. Generated traffic by: Visiting websites in the browser
4. Stopped the capture after ~1 minute.
5. Applied protocol filters: dns, tcp, http/tls, icmp.
6. Saved the capture as capture.pcap and documented findings.

**Protocols Identified**

1. DNS (Domain Name System) : Resolves domain names to IP addresses.       
2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) : Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
3. HTTP/HTTPS (Web Traffic) : Transfers web content between client and server.
4. ICMP (Ping) (optional) : Network diagnostics (Echo Request/Reply).

**Deliverables**
- capture.pcap – Wireshark capture file
- screenshots/ – Packet filter screenshots
- README.md – Report and documentation

## Outcome : Hands-on packet analysis skills and protocol awareness
